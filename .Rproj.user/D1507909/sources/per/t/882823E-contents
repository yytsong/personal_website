This post records my journey of building this personal website powered by hugo, R and netflip. It suits for R coders and anyone would like to customise themes from 'Giants' shoulders'.

## Step 1. Look around hugo themes

Jump on [Hugo Themes Complete List](https://themes.gohugo.io/) and go through demos to identify theme of interests. I feel that I relates to [Hugo Nix](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-nix/) theme.


## Step 2. Install Hugo

Go to [hugo releases](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases) and download an
appropriate version for your operating system. Save it under a specific path as we will be using it in the next step.

More complete instructions are available at [installing hugo](/overview/installing/)

## Step 2. Build the Docs

Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site
you are reading right now.

Follow the following steps:

 1. Clone the [hugo repository](http://github.com/spf13/hugo)
 2. Go into the repo
 3. Run hugo in server mode and build the docs
 4. Open your browser to http://localhost:1313

Corresponding pseudo commands:

    git clone https://github.com/spf13/hugo
    cd hugo
    /path/to/where/you/installed/hugo server --source=./docs
    > 29 pages created
    > 0 tags index created
    > in 27 ms
    > Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313
    > Press ctrl+c to stop

Once you've gotten here, follow along the rest of this page on your local build.

## Step 3. Change the docs site

Stop the Hugo process by hitting ctrl+c.

Now we are going to run hugo again, but this time with hugo in watch mode.

    /path/to/hugo/from/step/1/hugo server --source=./docs --watch
    > 29 pages created
    > 0 tags index created
    > in 27 ms
    > Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313
    > Watching for changes in /Users/spf13/Code/hugo/docs/content
    > Press ctrl+c to stop


Open your [favorite editor](http://vim.spf13.com) and change one of the source
content pages. How about changing this very file to *fix the typo*. How about changing this very file to *fix the typo*.

Content files are found in `docs/content/`. Unless otherwise specified, files
are located at the same relative location as the url, in our case
`docs/content/overview/quickstart.md`.

Change and save this file.. Notice what happened in your terminal.

    > Change detected, rebuilding site

    > 29 pages created
    > 0 tags index created
    > in 26 ms

Refresh the browser and observe that the typo is now fixed.

Notice how quick that was. Try to refresh the site before it's finished building.. I double dare you.
Having nearly instant feedback enables you to have your creativity flow without waiting for long builds.

## Step 4. Have fun

The best way to learn something is to play with it.
