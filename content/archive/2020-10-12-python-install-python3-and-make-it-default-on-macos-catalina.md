Comment: A nature and easy step-by-step guide to install Python3 using homebrew on macOS Catalina Version 10.15.7. Up in front, this mentor explained (1) switch command line to zsh instead of bash; (2) benefits of utilizing homebrew instead of anaconda for setting up python environment; (3) additional link for Mojave. This method also enables pip install of python packages, and make python3 default choice when calling python by updating .zshrc file (using Vim). I understand it is not the only way of installing python3 and make it default choice on mac, but I recommend this approach for a clean and fast start on python3.


Requirements: Users should not against installing X-code and homebrew on their systems.
